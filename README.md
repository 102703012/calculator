# Calculator

This example is also part of the homework 1. So some features are not all implemented. (Leave as homework)

You can use `CocoaPods` to integrate this Core by adding following lines to your `Podfile`:
```ruby
pod 'CalculatorCore', :git => 'https://github.com/sodascourse/calculator.git', :branch => 'master'
```
